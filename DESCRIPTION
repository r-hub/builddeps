Title: Find Build-Time Package Dependencies
Version: 1.0.0
Author: G치bor Cs치rdi
Maintainer: G치bor Cs치rdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: Most R package dependencies are run-time dependencies:
    functions within a package refer to functions or other objects within
    another package. These references are resolved at runtime, and for
    evaluating the code of a package (i.e. installing it), the dependencies
    are not actually needed. This package tries to work out the build-time
    and run-time dependencies of a package, by trying to evaluate the
    package code both without and with each dependency.
