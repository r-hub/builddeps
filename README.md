Most R package dependencies are run-time dependencies: functions within a
package refer to functions or other objects within another package. These
references are resolved at runtime, and for evaluating the code of a
package (i.e. installing it), the dependencies are not actually needed.
This package tries to work out the build-time and run-time dependencies of
a package, by trying to evaluate the package code both without and with
each dependency.

## Installation
